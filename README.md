# Silverstripe Glossary

Adds a Glossary section to CMS admin where glossary terms can be defined. These terms can then be added to content via
the WYSIWYG and the definitions will be rendered as interactive rollovers within webpage content.

## Requirements

* SilverStripe ^4.0
* PHP ^7.3

## Installation
Add some installation instructions here, having a 1 line composer copy and paste is useful.
Here is a composer command to create a new module project. Ensure you read the
['publishing a module'](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/developer_guides/extending/how_tos/publish_a_module/) guide
and update your module's composer.json to designate your code as a SilverStripe module.

```
composer require silverstripe-module/skeleton 4.x-dev
```

**Note:** When you have completed your module, submit it to Packagist or add it as a VCS repository to your
project's composer.json, pointing to the private repository URL.

## Maintainers
 * Adrian Jimson <adrian.jimson@silverstripe.com>
